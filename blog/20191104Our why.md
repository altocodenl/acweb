The purpose of Altocode.
# Our why

Altocode's mission is **to empower humans to empower themselves, other humans and the environment through software.**

Empowering means *to give power to.* We embrace a worldview where power is the opposite of a zero-sum game. The power to grow, to express ourselves, to resolve problems, to overcome scarcity and to find deep meaning - this power improves ourselves and the world around us.

We, the humans from Altocode, want to empower others; and in the process of doing it, empower ourselves.

And we do it leveraging two forces: the computer and the web. By creating and maintaining software that lives in the web, we seek to empower the world around us.
