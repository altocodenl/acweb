"You have to think of your company as part of a web of life, just like an organism in an ecosystem.”
# An organism

> Well, the reason I’m here is to remind you that maybe, just maybe, you too have a nagging, gagging sense that the current atmosphere of *disrupt-o-mania* isn’t the only air a startup can breathe. That perhaps this zeal for disruption is not only crowding out other motives for doing a startup, but also can be downright poisonous for everyone here and the rest of the world.

> Part of the problem seems to be that nobody these days is content to merely put their dent in the universe. No, they have to fucking **own** the universe. It’s not enough to be in the market, they have to **dominate** it. It’s not enough to serve customers, they have to **capture** them. [1]

> You have to think of your company as part of a web of life, just like an organism in an ecosystem. If you become too dominant, you suck all the life out of the ecosystem. It gets out of balance, and everyone suffers, eventually even the creatures that think themselves safe at the top of the pile.

> But more important, the idea that we should focus on disruption rather than the new value that we can create is at the heart of the current economic malaise, income inequality, and political upheaval. The secret to building a better future is to use technology to do things that were previously impossible. [2]
