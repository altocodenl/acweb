# ac;pic: photo albums don’t work

Albums made sense when photos were made of paper. 

To successfully organize digital photos, stop using albums.

For half a century we had a method: photos go in albums. But then we forgot to switch from organizing physical goods (paper) to digital assets. We kept the old system. 

Paper can only be in one place at a time (like in an album), but a digital asset can be in many places at the same time. 

We have more images and videos than ever before. And yet we’re using a solution from a time when this was not a problem. 

## A photo album is a box
A digital photo album is like a big box. You can have ‘the’ album (or folder) where all the photos go, just like the big box at home with all the paper photos. Or, you have an app where all the digital photo albums are. In that case, the app is the big box. 

The big box has small boxes - often in the form of subfolders or specific albums. Each small box has a label, such as ‘Vacations 2010’, ‘Graduation’, ‘Birthday 2015’, ‘Friends’, etc. If you’re very organized, inside each small box there are smaller boxes. Inside ‘Vacations 2010’ you might have ‘Las Vegas April 2010’ and ‘Cancun July 2010’.

The first problem with this ‘big box > small box > smaller box’ categorization is that it must be followed to maintain organization. It’s fixed. Can’t change it. Changing it is a lot of work. 

Each new photo entering the system must fall into an existing small box or a new one must be created. This new small box can be ‘uncategorized’ (the folder where the photos that do not belong anywhere go) or a new name must be created. 

The second problem with this *Matryoshka* is that you can’t see what’s in a folder unless you dig in. 

To see a photo, you have to remember the category system and go to the corresponding box. If you can’t remember the box naming conventions and/or hierarchy, you will be going in and out of boxes.

If you want to increase organization, the only way to filter down a small box is by creating more smaller boxes, which in turn reduce visibility and make the system more complex. More photos means more small boxes. More small boxes, the more difficult it is to find something. 

You’re trapped. 

## Simple is organized
The way to solve this is not by creating a better album system. Is by eliminating it altogether (ie: the solution to ‘expensive fuel’ is not ‘cheaper fuel’, but ‘electric car’).

Organization has to be simple, otherwise it won’t work. With <a href="https://altocode.nl/pic/" target="_blank">ac;pic</a> we asked ‘what does a <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/a-simple-product-looks-like-this" target="_blank">simple</a> product look like?’  
- Filenames don’t matter.
- You can see the photos and play the videos every time.
- No dead-ends (empty albums), nor ronin files (loose photos or videos that don’t belong to any place).
- You can see where images are saved, change the organization and placement without having to remember where things are. Everything is in front of you.
- Scalable. Whether you have 20 photos, 2,000 or 20,000 these same principles apply.

Simple is natural. The brain organizes memories by association. Association of places, people, context, moments. It only makes sense to <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/we-remember-by-association" target="_blank">have an organizational method</a> for photos and videos - triggers for memories - similar to the brains’ method. 

Organization is finding what you want when you want it. Photos and videos are memories, they make a moment last forever. Memories don't deserve boxes.
