Find a photo in 30 seconds. If you can’t find it before that, then your photos are not organized.
# tagaway: the 30-second rule

“Can I find a particular photo in 30 seconds or less?”. 

Sounds strange, but it makes all the difference. 

How many times you’ve been with friends or family and something like “hey, remember that time when Joe was covered in mud during that camping trip?” comes up? “We took a lot of pics, I have them somewhere”. You go to your social media platform of choice or to where your backed up photos are, but you can’t find them. 

If you can’t find them in a minute or so, the fun is gone. You can’t be there for 30 minutes looking for a photo. The moment is gone. 

That’s what we want to avoid. That’s why photos should be organized. That’s why we built <a href="https://altocode.nl/pic/" target="_blank">tagaway.</a>

Find a photo in 30 seconds. If you can’t find it before that, then your photos are not organized.
