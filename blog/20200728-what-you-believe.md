It’s probably not about what you know or don’t know. It’s about what you believe and your willingness to do it.
# What you believe

> “Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that **everything around you that you call ‘life’ was made up by people that were no smarter than you.** And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.” [1]

> “To do original work: It’s not necessary to know something nobody else knows. It is necessary to believe something few other people believe.” [2]
