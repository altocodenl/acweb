Focus on doing one thing well. That's what matters. 
#One thing well

*"Customers don’t want your product or what it does; they want help making themselves better (i.e., they want to transform a life-situation, make progress)."* (1) 

*"I decided to make a project that did only one thing and did it well, with the goal instead of succeeding being to not fail. Anything is better than never shipping. The result was BitTorrent."* (Bram Cohen) (2)

*“Once you’ve built something of value, your marketing isn’t telling people what it is; they’re smart enough to figure that out, telling them how they can use it.”* (3)

*“What we call profit being the reward for understanding an aspect of human nature ahead of the competition.”* (4)

Focus on solving one thing well. Focus on helping people become better versions of themselves. Tell them how they can use it. 

That's the focus.
