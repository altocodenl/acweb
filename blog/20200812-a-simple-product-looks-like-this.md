# ac;pic: a simple product looks like this

> "Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication." [1]

With <a href="https://altocode.nl/pic/" target="_blank">ac;pic</a>, we decided to build a simple product that does <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/one-thing-well" target="_blank">one thing well</a>: to have photos and videos organized. Designed with the user in mind - <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/facilitator" target="_blank">ourselves.</a>  

What does a simple product look like? 
- Filenames don’t matter. 
- You can see the photos and play the videos every time. 
- No dead-ends (empty albums), nor ronin files (loose photos or videos that don’t belong to any place). 
- You can see where images are saved, change the organization and placement without having to remember where things are. Everything is in front of you. 
- Scalable. Whether you have 20 photos, 2,000 or 20,000 these same principles apply. 

That’s what it looks like.
 
Simple is organized, complex doesn’t scale.
