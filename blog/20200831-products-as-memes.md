# Products as memes
> “[Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary theorist, who coined the term *meme*] pointed out that a meme was like a living organism, surviving not in the real world, but in our world of ideas.

> Like a real organism, memes could live and die, and more importantly, they could evolve. Every time a meme is passed from person to person, it gets touched, changed, and—sometimes—improved.

> Once a meme has been passed around enough, it ceases to evolve as quickly and just becomes a building block for future memes.” [1]

Just like your favorite memes, successful products and ideas are building blocks for future products and ideas. Everything we have is built on top of previous ideas, *memes*. 

When building, you’re also enabling what comes next. 

If you can, make it as easy as possible for the next iteration of ideas to happen.
