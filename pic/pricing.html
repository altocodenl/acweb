         <p class="pricing-questions-answers">Our pricing has two objectives:
            <ol>
               <li class="pricing-questions-answers-li">Be able to pay for the team and ensure the future of the company.</li>
               <li class="pricing-questions-answers-li">Be as low as possible, without compromising the viability of the company.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="pricing-questions-answers">If we ensure the future and viability of the company, then we can make sure that:</p>
            <ul>
               <li class="pricing-questions-answers-li">Our company - and the product - will continue to exist.</li>
               <li class="pricing-questions-answers-li">We won’t need to bring outside capital. If we bring outside capital, then the company’s control could be compromised. That could directly clash with our principle of <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/our-how" target="_blank">passing as much value to users by not maximizing revenue, never selling the company, working in the open and charging as low as possible.</a></li>
               <li class="pricing-questions-answers-li">We won’t need to monetize our user’s data in indirect ways - namely, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-lawsuit-photo-privacy-illinois-1849015776" target="_blank">by using their data for other purposes unrelated to the product.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pricing-questions-answers">
            As we grow, we will experience economies of scale and our product will become cheaper. <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/our-what" target="_blank">We plan on lowering our prices as that happens, rather than increasing our profits.</a><br><br>
            Note how this is the exact opposite of what most online services do: start with artificially low prices funded by VC capital, get as many users as possible, and then raise prices, sell user data, <a href="https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/about/" target="_blank">sell the company,</a> or go bankrupt (or all of the above).
            </p>
         </p>
         <h3 class="pricing-questions-title">Wouldn’t it be easier to charge a flat fee like everybody else?</h3>
         <p class="pricing-questions-answers">If we'd charge a flat fee - users pay a fixed monthly fee and they get a certain amount of GB -, we would benefit from users using the least amount of storage possible. More storage is more cost, hence less profit. We would charge a reasonable-but-a-little-high monthly fee and give users a huge amount of storage at their disposal. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This creates an illusion of abundance.</span> Users believe that they have a lot of space available - which is good for them-, but really don't use that much space - which is good for the company's profit. If all users used all the storage space at their disposal, then the company would have to raise prices.<br><br>There's also another downside to the flat-fee model: users who use little space are de-facto subsidizing those who use more space. Ideally, no user should have to pay for the cost of another user.<br><br>This is called the <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/flat-rate-bias" target="_blank">‘flat-rate bias’.</a>
         </p>
         <h3 class="pricing-questions-title">How did you get to this pricing model?</h3>
         <p class="pricing-questions-answers">This is a fully transparent model. Our users have clarity on how we price the product, they can control how much they spend and it's clear on where their money is going. A flat-fee model would put our incentives in opposition to our users, so we chose a model where we profit from a fixed fee and our users get the space at a cost value.<br><br> If you want full details on how this pricing works and why, here’s <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/how-we-calculated-the-price-of-acpic" target="_blank">how we calculated the price of tagaway.</a>
         </p>
         <h3 class="pricing-questions-title">Why different prices inside and outside the European Union?</h3>
         <p class="pricing-questions-answers">This is to keep things fair between European and non-European users. This fairness ensures that both European and non-European users are equally profitable to us.<br><br>We have different costs for europeans and non-europeans (taxes, credit card processing fees, etc). If you’d like all the details, <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/how-we-calculated-the-price-of-acpic" target="_blank">you can find them here.</a><br><br> As for the storage, the cost we have as of today is €0.05 per GB. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We don’t make any profit from storage. tagaway's users pay storage at cost.</span> The slight price difference has to do with credit card processing fees.<br><br>And if storage gets cheaper for us, it will get cheaper for our users.
         </p>
         <h3 class="pricing-questions-title">Why charge only in Euros?</h3>
         <p class="pricing-questions-answers">Our wages are in euros, our costs are in euros, as well as our taxes. Having other currencies would complicate things for no good reason.

            <p>Our pricing has two objectives:

               <li class="pricing-questions-answers-li">Be as low as possible, without compromising the viability of the company.</li>

               <li class="pricing-questions-answers-li">We won’t need to bring outside capital. If we bring outside capital, then the company’s control could be compromised. That could directly clash with our principle of <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/our-how" target="_blank">passing as much value to users by not maximizing revenue, never selling the company, working in the open and charging as low as possible.</a></li>
               <li class="pricing-questions-answers-li">We won’t need to monetize our user’s data in indirect ways - namely, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-lawsuit-photo-privacy-illinois-1849015776" target="_blank">by using their data for other purposes unrelated to the product.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pricing-questions-answers">
            As we grow, we will experience economies of scale and our product will become cheaper. <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/our-what" target="_blank">We plan on lowering our prices as that happens, rather than increasing our profits.</a><br><br>
            Note how this is the exact opposite of what most online services do: start with artificially low prices funded by VC capital, get as many users as possible, and then raise prices, sell user data, <a href="https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/about/" target="_blank">sell the company,</a> or go bankrupt (or all of the above).

         </div>
         <div class="mobile-questions-answer">
            <p>If we'd charge a flat fee - users pay a fixed monthly fee and they get a certain amount of GB -, we would benefit from users using the least amount of storage possible. More storage is more cost, hence less profit. We would charge a reasonable-but-a-little-high monthly fee and give users a huge amount of storage at their disposal. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This creates an illusion of abundance.</span> Users believe that they have a lot of space available - which is good for them-, but really don't use that much space - which is good for the company's profit. If all users used all the storage space at their disposal, then the company would have to raise prices.<br><br>There's also another downside to the flat-fee model: users who use little space are de-facto subsidizing those who use more space. Ideally, no user should have to pay for the cost of another user.<br><br>This is called the <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/flat-rate-bias" target="_blank">‘flat-rate bias’.</a>

         <div class="mobile-questions-answer">
            <p>This is a fully transparent model. Our users have clarity on how we price the product, they can control how much they spend and it's clear on where their money is going. A flat-fee model would put our incentives in opposition to our users, so we chose a model where we profit from a fixed fee and our users get the space at a cost value.<br><br> If you want full details on how this pricing works and why, here’s <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/how-we-calculated-the-price-of-acpic" target="_blank">how we calculated the price of tagaway.</a>

            <p>This is to keep things fair between European and non-European users. This fairness ensures that both European and non-European users are equally profitable to us.<br><br>We have different costs for europeans and non-europeans (taxes, credit card processing fees, etc). If you’d like all the details, <a href="https://altocode.nl/blog/how-we-calculated-the-price-of-acpic" target="_blank">you can find them here.</a><br><br> As for the storage, the cost we have as of today is €0.05 per GB. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We don’t make any profit from storage. tagaway's users pay storage at cost.</span> The slight price difference has to do with credit card processing fees.<br><br>And if storage gets cheaper for us, it will get cheaper for our users.
